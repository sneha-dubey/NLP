In static_rnn(), the length of the input sequence is fixed and determined when the graph is constructed, which can be limiting when dealing with datasets that have sequences of varying length.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, dynamic_rnn() allows for the input sequences to be of variable length by using a TensorFlow Tensor object of shape [batch_size, max_sequence_length, input_size], where max_sequence_length can vary from batch to batch. This makes it easier to handle sequences of different lengths, since the RNN computation graph is created dynamically based on the actual sequence lengths.using dynamic_rnn() is that it can be more memory-efficient than static_rnn(). In static_rnn(), the graph is unrolled for a fixed number of time steps, which can lead to memory inefficiencies when dealing with long sequences. In contrast, dynamic_rnn() dynamically constructs the graph only for the necessary time steps, which can lead to lower memory usage."
